# Project Name

**Author**: Sarah and Daniel
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application has a local server created from the Express framework that listens for changes on the new.html page and sends any new articles submitted to the server. It also has set up new routes for the index.html and new.html pages (/home and /new, respectively), and throws up a 404 page for any other routes.

## Getting Started
User must initialize the project with 'npm init', install express and body-parser, and then set up their server with express and run it through node server (or nodemon). The user then has to set their port with a default of 3000, set up their routes, and set the application to listen from the port.

## Architecture
This application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars, Express, Body Parser, nodemon, and Ajax.
